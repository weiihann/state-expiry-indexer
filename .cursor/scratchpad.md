# State Expiry Indexer: Comprehensive Analytics Extension

## Background and Motivation

### Analytics Extension Overview
The current analytics system provides basic state expiry analysis but needs comprehensive extension to support detailed state analysis questions. The user has requested support for 15 specific analytics questions that require new data structures, API endpoints, and database queries.

**Current Analytics System Status:**
‚úÖ **Existing Analytics (Partially Complete):**
- Account expiry analysis (EOA vs Contract) - Questions 1, 4 (partial)
- Storage slot expiry analysis - Questions 4 (partial)
- Top contracts by expired storage slots - Question 7
- Contract storage expiry percentages - Question 11
- Fully expired contracts - Question 9
- Active contracts with expired storage - Question 8

‚ùå **Missing Analytics (New Requirements):**
- Single access frequency analysis - Question 5
- Block activity analysis - Questions 6, 13
- Time series analysis - Questions 12, 14
- Storage volume analysis - Questions 10, 15
- Enhanced total counts - Questions 1-3 (complete breakdown)

**Target Questions for Implementation:**
1. What is the total number of EOA accounts?
2. What is the total number of contract accounts?
3. What is the total number of storage slots?
4. How many accounts/storage slots are expired?
5. How many accounts/storage slots are only accessed once?
6. What blocks saw the highest combined account+storage access count?
7. What are the top 10 contracts by expired number of storage slots?
8. How many contracts are still active but have mostly expired storage?
9. How many contracts have all of their storage slots expired?
10. How many contracts have all of their storage slots active?
11. What is the average storage slots expiry percentage for each contract?
12. How does the number of state access (EOAs, contracts, storage slots) changed over time?
13. How many accounts/slots are accessed per N blocks?
14. What is the average access frequency of accounts or slots?
15. What are the top 10 contracts by number of storage slots?
