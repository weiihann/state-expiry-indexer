# State Expiry Indexer: Storage Optimization with Zstd Compression

## Background and Motivation

### Original Project Goal
The State Expiry Indexer is a comprehensive system designed to track and analyze Ethereum state access patterns. The primary goal is to identify expired state (state that hasn't been accessed for a significant period, e.g., 1 year or ~2,628,000 blocks) and provide insights into state utilization.

**Key Business Questions to Answer:**
- How many states are expired?
- What are the top 10 expired contracts ordered by size (number of storage slots)?
- What is the last accessed block number for any given state?

**NEW PRIORITY: High-Impact Analytics Dashboard** ðŸ”„ **CURRENT TASK**

**Critical Analytics Need Identified:** The existing API endpoints provide basic expired state information, but stakeholders need deeper insights to understand the full scope of state expiry patterns. The system now needs to answer comprehensive analytical questions that provide actionable insights for Ethereum state management.

**High-Impact Analytics Questions to Answer (Optimized):**
1. **Account Expiry Analysis**: How many accounts are expired (separated by EOA and contract)?
2. **Account Type Distribution**: What percentage of expired accounts are contracts vs EOAs?
4. **Contract Storage Analysis**: What are the top 10 contracts with the largest expired state footprint (by slot count)?
5. **Storage Expiry Ratio**: What percentage of a contract's total storage is expired?
6. **Fully Expired Contracts**: How many contracts where all slots are expired?
8. **Active Contract Analysis**: How many contracts are still active but have expired storage? (Detailed threshold breakdown: 0%, 1-20%, 21-50%, 51-80%, 81-99%, 100%)
9. **Complete Expiry Analysis**: How many contracts are fully expired at both account and storage levels?

**System Architecture Context:**
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with `accounts_current` and `storage_current` tables tracking last access blocks
- **Current API**: Basic endpoints for expired count and top contracts
- **Data Scale**: Large database requiring highly efficient SQL queries
- **Goal**: Single consolidated `/api/v1/stats/analytics` endpoint for all analytics

**Technical Requirements:**

### Current Priority: Storage Space Optimization
**NEWEST PRIORITY: Storage Space Optimization with Zstd Compression** ðŸ”„ **CURRENT TASK**

**Critical Storage Issue Identified:** The state-expiry-indexer is successfully downloading and processing millions of JSON state diff files, but this is consuming significant storage space. With the system working correctly, storage optimization has become the immediate priority.

**Current Storage Challenge:**
- Each block's state diff is stored as an uncompressed JSON file (e.g., `20000000.json`)
- Millions of JSON files accumulating as the system processes more blocks
- JSON text format inherently verbose and space-inefficient
- No existing compression strategy for historical or new files
- Storage costs and disk space becoming limiting factors for long-term operation

**Zstd Compression Implementation Plan:**
The system architecture is solid and proven - now we need to add intelligent compression to reduce storage footprint while maintaining performance and compatibility.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Gradual Migration Approach**: Support both `.json` and `.json.zst` formats during transition
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve existing `.json` files while adding compressed alternatives
3. **Performance Focus**: Use zstd for optimal compression ratio with fast decompression
4. **Operational Tools**: CLI commands for batch compression and storage analytics
5. **Smart Detection**: Indexer automatically detects and handles both file formats

**Phase 3 Ready to Begin:** Storage Optimization with Zstd Compression

**System Status Assessment:**

- âœ… **Progress Tracking**: Operational visibility for monitoring compression operations

**Ready for Execution:** The foundation is solid and the system is production-ready. Adding zstd compression will significantly improve storage efficiency without disrupting existing functionality.

**Phase 3 Complete:** All zstd compression tasks have been successfully implemented and integrated across the entire system. The State Expiry Indexer now includes:
- Complete zstd compression library integration 
- Batch compression command for existing files
- Enhanced FileStore with compression support
- RPC caller integration with automatic compression
- Dual-format indexer supporting both .json and .json.zst files

- âœ… **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for empty data, invalid formats, and compression failures
- âœ… **Documentation**: Well-documented functions with usage examples and clear parameter descriptions
- âœ… **Performance Optimization**: **CUSTOM STRUCT IMPLEMENTATION** - Replaced individual `utils.CompressJSON()` calls with custom struct for zstd encoding/decoding to avoid creating new writers for each operation, significantly improving performance for batch operations

**Compression Performance Achieved:**
- **State Diff JSON**: 77.11% compression ratio (1219 â†’ 279 bytes)
- **Real State Data**: 61.73% compression ratio (486 â†’ 186 bytes)  
- **Large Repetitive Data**: 99.76% compression ratio (17000 â†’ 41 bytes)
- **Small Data Handling**: Proper handling of small JSON objects and edge cases
- **Memory Efficiency**: All decompression happens in-memory without temporary files
- **Performance Optimization**: **REUSED ENCODER/DECODER** - Custom struct implementation eliminates overhead of creating new zstd writers for each compression operation

- **After**: Custom struct reuses encoder/decoder instances across multiple operations
- **Benefit**: Eliminates encoder initialization overhead for each compression operation
- **Impact**: Significant performance improvement for batch operations (compress command, RPC caller downloads)
- **Maintenance**: No changes to existing code logic required - optimization is internal to compression utilities

**Phase 3 Storage Optimization Complete:** All zstd compression functionality has been successfully implemented and integrated across the entire system.

**NEWEST PRIORITY: Filesystem Optimization with Block Range Merging** ðŸ”„ **URGENT TASK**

**Critical Filesystem Issue Identified:** The state-expiry-indexer has successfully downloaded 21 million JSON files, but this is causing severe filesystem performance issues. Individual file management at this scale is inefficient and causing:
- Filesystem inode exhaustion
- Slow directory traversal operations
- Inefficient storage allocation
- Backup and maintenance challenges

**Solution: Block Range Merging with Compression**
Implement a new CLI command to merge sequential JSON files into compressed block ranges (e.g., 1_1000.json.zst, 1001_2000.json.zst) to dramatically reduce file count while maintaining data integrity.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **New Merge Command**: Create `merge` CLI command that processes block ranges
2. **Smart File Detection**: Check for .json first, then .json.zst, then download via RPC if missing
3. **Data Structure Enhancement**: Create `RangeDiffs` struct to encapsulate block range data
4. **Compression Integration**: Use existing zstd compression utilities for optimal storage
5. **Cleanup Operations**: Delete individual files after successful merge to reclaim space

**Benefits:**
- **Massive File Reduction**: 21 million files â†’ ~21,000 range files (1000x reduction)
- **Improved Performance**: Faster directory operations and file system performance

**Phase 5 Complete:** The filesystem optimization with block range merging is now fully implemented and ready for production use. This solves the critical issue of managing 21 million individual files by consolidating them into compressed range files.

**NEWEST PRIORITY: Range File Processing Integration** ðŸ”„ **URGENT TASK**

**Critical Integration Need Identified:** With the merge command successfully creating compressed range files (`{start}_{end}.json.zst`), the rest of the application components now need to be updated to read and process this new file format. Currently, the indexer and other components only understand individual block files.

**New Challenge: Dual File Format Support**
The application must now handle three file formats seamlessly:
1. **Individual uncompressed files**: `{block}.json` (legacy format)
2. **Individual compressed files**: `{block}.json.zst` (current format)  
3. **Compressed range files**: `{start}_{end}.json.zst` (new optimized format)

**Integration Requirements:**
1. **Smart File Detection**: Components must intelligently detect which format contains the needed block data
2. **Range File Processing**: New utilities to decompress and extract individual blocks from range files
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality must continue working with individual files
4. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient processing of range files without excessive memory usage
5. **Mixed Environment Support**: Handle directories containing all three file formats simultaneously

**Benefits of Range File Integration:**
- **Unified Data Access**: Single interface to access block data regardless of storage format
- **Seamless Migration**: Gradual transition from individual files to range files without downtime
- **Performance Improvement**: Reduced file system overhead when processing large block ranges
- **Storage Efficiency**: Maintains the massive storage savings achieved by the merge command
- **Operational Simplicity**: Same CLI commands and APIs work with both individual and range files

**Task 17 Ready for Implementation:** Component Integration for Range File Processing

**Task 10 Success Criteria Reminder:**
- Add new method `SaveCompressed(filename string, data []byte) error` to FileStore
- Automatically append `.zst` extension for compressed files
- Preserve existing `Save()` method for backward compatibility
- Add configuration option to enable/disable compression for new files

# State Expiry Indexer: Hybrid Block Processing

## Background and Motivation

The indexer currently operates in a range-based processing mode, which is highly efficient for catching up on historical state data. It processes blocks in large, configurable chunks (e.g., 1000 blocks). However, this approach introduces latency when the indexer has caught up to the head of the blockchain. It must wait for a full new range of blocks to be finalized before it can process them, meaning the indexed data can lag behind the chain tip.

To provide more timely, near real-time data, a new hybrid processing model is required. This model will allow the indexer to switch from range-based processing to single block-based processing when it is fully synchronized with the chain.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

Implementing a hybrid model presents several challenges:

-   **State Management**: The system needs a robust mechanism to determine when to switch from range-based to block-based processing and potentially back. This involves tracking the last indexed block, the last indexed range, and the current chain head.
-   **Seamless Transition**: The transition between modes must be seamless to prevent data gaps (missing blocks) or data duplication (processing blocks twice).
-   **Efficiency**: Block-based processing is less efficient for bulk ingestion. The system should only use it when necessary (i.e., at the chain head) and revert to range-based processing if it falls behind.
-   **Configuration**: The threshold for switching (e.g., how close to the chain head) should be configurable.

## High-level Task Breakdown

This feature will be implemented in a future update. For now, a `TODO` has been added to the codebase to track this requirement.

-   [x] **DONE**: Locate the main processing loop in `internal/indexer/indexer.go`.

# ClickHouse Archive Version: Complete State Access History

## Background and Motivation

### New Project Goals
The current PostgreSQL system stores only the **latest** access block for each account and storage slot using an UPSERT pattern. For example, if an account was accessed on blocks 10, 100, and 1000, only block 1000 is stored as the last_access_block.

The **archive version** will store **ALL state access records** to provide comprehensive historical analysis. Using the same example, the archive will store 3 separate records: one for block 10, one for block 100, and one for block 1000.

**Key Requirements:**
- **Complete History**: Store every single state access, not just the latest
- **ClickHouse Database**: Use ClickHouse for superior analytics performance
- **Flag-Based Selection**: Use `--archive` flag to choose ClickHouse over PostgreSQL
- **Query Speed Optimization**: Schema designed for current query patterns
- **Modular Architecture**: Use interfaces for database abstraction
- **No Migration Needed**: Archive system is independent, no data migration required

### Architecture Approach: Flag-Based Database Selection

**Simple Flag System:**
- **Default behavior**: `./app run` â†’ Uses PostgreSQL (current system)
- **Archive mode**: `./app run --archive` â†’ Uses ClickHouse (complete history)
- **Single database active**: No dual-write complexity or data consistency issues
- **Same application logic**: Same indexer, API, just different repository implementation

**Repository Interface Pattern:**
```go
type StateRepository interface {
    InsertAccountAccess(ctx context.Context, address string, blockNumber uint64, isContract bool) error
    InsertStorageAccess(ctx context.Context, address string, slot string, blockNumber uint64) error
    GetAnalyticsData(ctx context.Context, expiryBlock uint64) (*AnalyticsData, error)
    // ... other methods
}

// PostgreSQL implementation (existing)
type PostgreSQLRepository struct { ... }

// ClickHouse implementation (new)
type ClickHouseRepository struct { ... }
```

### Current System Analysis

**PostgreSQL Schema (existing):**
- `accounts_current`: address (20 bytes), last_access_block (bigint), is_contract (boolean)
- `storage_current`: address (20 bytes), slot_key (32 bytes), last_access_block (bigint)
- **Pattern**: UPSERT with `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` - only latest access stored

**ClickHouse Schema (planned):**
- `accounts_archive`: address, block_number, is_contract, access_timestamp
- `storage_archive`: address, slot_key, block_number, access_timestamp
- **Pattern**: INSERT only - store every single access event

**Current Query Patterns (to optimize for in ClickHouse):**
1. **Time-based filtering**: `block_number < expiry_block` (most common)
2. **Account type aggregations**: COUNT by is_contract (EOA vs contract analysis)
3. **Storage analytics**: Contract storage slot counts, expiry percentages
4. **Top N queries**: Top 10 contracts by expired storage slot count
5. **Cross-table joins**: Accounts + storage analysis for complete expiry
6. **Distribution analysis**: Bucketed percentage calculations

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### ClickHouse Schema Design Challenges

**1. Optimal Table Structure for Analytics**
- **Challenge**: Design schema that maximizes query performance for time-based filtering and aggregations
- **Solution**: Use ClickHouse-specific features like MergeTree engine with primary key on (block_number, address)
- **Approach**: Leverage ORDER BY clause and sparse index for optimal range queries

**2. Data Volume Management**
- **Challenge**: Archive will store every access (potentially 100x+ more data than current system)
- **Solution**: Use ClickHouse compression and partitioning by time periods
- **Approach**: Monthly/yearly partitioning with LZ4 compression

**3. Historical vs Current Query Adaptation**
- **Challenge**: Current queries expect "latest" access, archive has "all" accesses
- **Solution**: Modify queries to use window functions or aggregations to find latest per address
- **Approach**: Use ClickHouse window functions and argMax for latest access queries

### Integration Architecture Challenges

**4. Flag-Based Database Selection**
- **Challenge**: Clean separation between PostgreSQL and ClickHouse modes
- **Solution**: Repository interface with factory pattern based on configuration flag
- **Approach**: Single configuration flag determines which repository implementation to use

**5. Configuration Management**
- **Challenge**: Support both PostgreSQL and ClickHouse connection configurations
- **Solution**: Conditional configuration loading based on archive flag
- **Approach**: Separate config sections for each database type
