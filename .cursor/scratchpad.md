# State Expiry Indexer: Storage Optimization with Zstd Compression

## Background and Motivation

### Original Project Goal
The State Expiry Indexer is a comprehensive system designed to track and analyze Ethereum state access patterns. The primary goal is to identify expired state (state that hasn't been accessed for a significant period, e.g., 1 year or ~2,628,000 blocks) and provide insights into state utilization.

**Key Business Questions to Answer:**
- How many states are expired?
- What are the top 10 expired contracts ordered by size (number of storage slots)?
- What is the last accessed block number for any given state?

### Current Status
Based on analysis of the codebase, significant progress has been made by previous Planner and Executor:

**✅ Completed Components:**
1. **RPC Client** (`pkg/rpc`): Implements Ethereum RPC calls including `GetLatestBlockNumber` and `GetStateDiff`
2. **File Storage** (`pkg/storage`): Simple file storage for state diff JSON files
3. **Block Tracker** (`pkg/tracker`): File-based tracking of last processed block
4. **Database Repository** (`internal/repository`): PostgreSQL operations for accounts/storage state tracking
5. **State Indexer** (`internal/indexer`): Core indexing logic that processes state diff files and updates database
6. **API Server** (`internal/api`): HTTP endpoints for querying state data
7. **CLI Structure** (`cmd/`): Cobra-based CLI with root and run commands
8. **Database Schema**: PostgreSQL tables with proper partitioning and domains
9. **Docker Compose**: PostgreSQL database setup

**✅ Architectural Separation Completed:**
- **Independent Workflows**: RPC caller and indexer now run as separate, fault-tolerant processes
- **Separate State Tracking**: Download tracker and process tracker for independent progress management  
- **CLI Command Separation**: `download`, `index`, and `run` commands for different operation modes
- **Genesis Processing**: Complete implementation for handling Ethereum genesis block initial state
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive progress reporting for both download and indexing workflows
- **Download-Only Mode**: Resource-efficient mode for data collection without database overhead

### Current Priority: Storage Space Optimization
**NEWEST PRIORITY: Storage Space Optimization with Zstd Compression** 🔄 **CURRENT TASK**

**Critical Storage Issue Identified:** The state-expiry-indexer is successfully downloading and processing millions of JSON state diff files, but this is consuming significant storage space. With the system working correctly, storage optimization has become the immediate priority.

**Current Storage Challenge:**
- Each block's state diff is stored as an uncompressed JSON file (e.g., `20000000.json`)
- Millions of JSON files accumulating as the system processes more blocks
- JSON text format inherently verbose and space-inefficient
- No existing compression strategy for historical or new files
- Storage costs and disk space becoming limiting factors for long-term operation

**Zstd Compression Implementation Plan:**
The system architecture is solid and proven - now we need to add intelligent compression to reduce storage footprint while maintaining performance and compatibility.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Gradual Migration Approach**: Support both `.json` and `.json.zst` formats during transition
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve existing `.json` files while adding compressed alternatives
3. **Performance Focus**: Use zstd for optimal compression ratio with fast decompression
4. **Operational Tools**: CLI commands for batch compression and storage analytics
5. **Smart Detection**: Indexer automatically detects and handles both file formats

**Phase 3 Ready to Begin:** Storage Optimization with Zstd Compression

**System Status Assessment:**
- ✅ **Architecture**: Robust separation of concerns with independent RPC caller and indexer processes
- ✅ **Database**: Complete schema with proper migrations and genesis processing

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Phase 1 & 2 Successfully Completed:** All core integration and architectural separation tasks have been completed successfully, providing a robust foundation with proper separation of concerns and comprehensive feature set.

**Major Architectural Achievement:** The critical architectural separation has been successfully implemented, transforming the tightly-coupled workflow into independent, fault-tolerant processes.

**Task 5 Completed Successfully:** Separate RPC Caller and Indexer Workflows
- ✅ **Independent RPC Caller Process**: Dedicated workflow for data collection that polls for new blocks, downloads state diffs, saves files, and tracks "last_downloaded_block"
- ✅ **Independent Indexer Process**: Dedicated workflow for data processing that scans for new files, processes them into database, and tracks "last_indexed_block"  
- ✅ **Separate State Tracking**: Implemented dual tracking system with DownloadTracker and ProcessTracker for independent progress management
- ✅ **Independent Error Handling**: Each process has its own retry logic, error recovery, and fault tolerance mechanisms
- ✅ **Fault Tolerance**: RPC caller can continue independently if indexer fails, indexer can catch up independently without data loss
- ✅ **CLI Command Separation**: Added `download` command for RPC-only operation, `index` command for processing-only operation, and enhanced `run` command for coordinated operation
- ✅ **Testing Support**: Indexer can now be tested independently with static files, eliminating RPC dependencies for unit testing
- ✅ **Recovery Scenarios**: Full replay capability - can restart indexing from any point without re-downloading data
- ✅ **Graceful Coordination**: Indexer waits for files to be available and properly coordinates with RPC caller without getting ahead

**Task 6 Completed Successfully:** Genesis File Processing Implementation  
- ✅ **Genesis File Parsing**: Successfully implemented parsing of the 678KB `data/genesis.json` file containing Ethereum genesis block allocation data
- ✅ **Account Extraction**: Extracts account addresses and balances from genesis allocation data with proper hex address handling

**Task 7 Completed Successfully:** Progress Tracking for Download and Processing Workflows
- ✅ **Simple Progress Implementation**: Added lightweight progress tracking directly in RPC caller and indexer services without external dependencies
- ✅ **Download Progress**: RPC caller shows download progress every 1000 blocks or 8 seconds with current block, target block, and remaining count
- ✅ **Index Progress**: Indexer shows processing progress every 1000 blocks or 8 seconds during both range processing and file processing workflows
- ✅ **Time-Based Progress**: Progress displayed every 8 seconds regardless of block count to provide regular status updates
- ✅ **Block-Based Progress**: Progress displayed every 1000 blocks to avoid overwhelming the logs while providing meaningful updates
- ✅ **Structured Logging**: All progress messages use structured logging with consistent format and relevant context
- ✅ **Performance Friendly**: Minimal overhead progress tracking that doesn't impact processing performance
- ✅ **Multiple Workflows**: Progress tracking works in all CLI commands (download, index, run) and both indexer workflows (range and file processing)
- ✅ **No Configuration Needed**: Hardcoded constants (1000 blocks, 8 seconds) provide sensible defaults without configuration complexity

**NEWEST TASK COMPLETED:** Download-Only CLI Flag Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ **CLI Flag Added**: Successfully added `--download-only` flag to the `run` command that disables both indexer and API components
- ✅ **Database Operations Skipped**: In download-only mode, database migrations, connections, and repository initialization are completely bypassed
- ✅ **Component Isolation**: Only the RPC caller service is initialized and started, with indexer and API server components disabled

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**APIHost Configuration Implementation Complete:** I have successfully implemented the proper use of the APIHost configuration parameter in the API server. The issue was identified and resolved with the following changes:

**Problem Identified:**
- The API server's `Run` method was only accepting a `port` parameter
- The server was binding to all interfaces (`:%d`) instead of the configured host
- The `config.APIHost` parameter was being logged but not actually used

**Technical Implementation:**
- **API Server Method Signature**: Updated `func (s *Server) Run(ctx context.Context, port int)` to `func (s *Server) Run(ctx context.Context, host string, port int)`
- **Server Address Binding**: Changed from `fmt.Sprintf(":%d", port)` to `fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d", host, port)` to properly bind to the specified host
- **Logging Enhancement**: Updated logging to include both host and port information for better debugging
- **Call Site Update**: Modified `cmd/run.go` to pass `config.APIHost` parameter to the API server
- **Error Logging**: Enhanced error logging to include both host and port context

**Verification:**
- ✅ Code compiles successfully after changes
- ✅ API server now properly uses the configured host from `config.APIHost`
- ✅ Server binding address correctly formatted as `host:port` instead of just `:port`
- ✅ Logging provides clear host and port information for operational visibility
- ✅ Error handling includes complete context (host + port)

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# API server will bind to localhost:8080 (default config)
go run main.go run

# Can be configured via environment variables:
export API_HOST=0.0.0.0  # Bind to all interfaces
export API_PORT=9000     # Custom port
go run main.go run

# Or via config file:
API_HOST=127.0.0.1
API_PORT=8080
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
1. **Security**: Can now bind to specific interfaces (e.g., localhost only) instead of all interfaces
2. **Network Control**: Supports binding to specific IP addresses for multi-homed systems
3. **Container Deployment**: Enables proper container networking with specific host binding
4. **Development Flexibility**: Allows developers to bind to localhost while production can bind to specific interfaces
5. **Configuration Consistency**: All configuration parameters are now actually used as intended

**Configuration Options Available:**
- `API_HOST=localhost` - Bind to localhost only (secure default)
- `API_HOST=0.0.0.0` - Bind to all interfaces (for container deployments)
- `API_HOST=127.0.0.1` - Bind to loopback interface specifically
- `API_HOST=10.0.0.5` - Bind to specific IP address

**Ready for Next Task:** The APIHost configuration is now properly implemented and working as expected. The API server will respect the configured host parameter for network binding, providing better security and deployment flexibility.

**Download-Only CLI Flag Implementation Complete:** I have successfully implemented the requested CLI flag functionality with the following achievements:

**Feature Implementation:**
- **New CLI Flag**: Added `--download-only` boolean flag to the `run` command
- **Component Isolation**: When flag is enabled, only the RPC caller (downloader) component runs
- **Database Bypass**: All database operations (migrations, connections, repository initialization) are skipped in download-only mode
- **API Disable**: API server is completely disabled when running in download-only mode
- **Indexer Disable**: Indexer processor workflow is completely disabled when running in download-only mode

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- **Conditional Service Startup**: Added proper if/else logic to conditionally initialize and start services based on the flag
- **Resource Management**: Database connections and repository objects are only created when needed (not in download-only mode)
- **Type Safety**: Fixed import declarations and variable types to use correct `*pgxpool.Pool` type
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Download-only mode still supports proper signal handling and graceful shutdown
- **Logging Enhancement**: Added clear status messages indicating which services are running/disabled

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Run all components (default behavior)
go run main.go run

# Run only the downloader component  
go run main.go run --download-only

# View help for the new flag
go run main.go run --help
```

**Testing Verification:**
- ✅ CLI help properly displays the new flag and its description
- ✅ Flag registration works correctly with cobra command framework
- ✅ Code compiles without errors after type fixes
- ✅ Conditional logic properly isolates services based on flag value

**Operational Benefits:**
1. **Resource Efficiency**: Can run lightweight download-only instances without database overhead
2. **Development Workflow**: Enables separation of data collection from processing during development
3. **Distributed Architecture**: Supports scenarios where downloading and indexing happen on different machines
4. **Debugging**: Isolates RPC caller issues from database and indexer problems
5. **Fault Tolerance**: Can continue data collection even if database or indexer components have issues

**Ready for Next Task:** The download-only functionality is complete and working. The system now supports three deployment modes:
1. **Full Mode**: `go run main.go run` (RPC caller + indexer + API)
2. **Download-Only**: `go run main.go run --download-only` (RPC caller only)
3. **Individual Commands**: `go run main.go download` or `go run main.go index` (separate processes)

This provides maximum flexibility for different operational requirements and deployment scenarios.

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Test against a real database instance to catch more realistic bugs.
- When refactoring, move code in small, incremental chunks and re-run the application to ensure nothing is broken.
- Previous team built solid individual components but failed at integration - focus on making them work together first
- Database schema is well-designed with proper domains and partitioning
- Configuration system is basic but functional - enhance it for production use
- Use established libraries like golang-migrate instead of building custom migration systems - they handle edge cases better
- golang-migrate provides excellent CLI and library interfaces - both work seamlessly together
- Test both success and error cases when implementing new functionality
- When planning testing phases, prioritize genesis processing since it establishes the foundational state for all subsequent testing
- Large data files like genesis.json require batch processing strategies for efficient database operations
- Test data should match production data structures exactly to ensure realistic testing scenarios
- **Architectural separation is critical for fault tolerance** - tightly coupled processes create single points of failure and limit recovery options
- **Independent state tracking enables replay scenarios** - separate tracking for downloads vs processing allows flexible recovery
- **Process separation improves testing** - can test components independently without external dependencies
