- **Impact**: Tests now produce consistent, reproducible results for expiry and single access analytics
- **System Status**: The analytics system is fully functional with optimized performance for ClickHouse backend and comprehensive deterministic test infrastructure
- **Architecture**: Successfully simplified to single-database implementation with improved maintainability and robust testing capabilities

## Lessons

### Architectural Decisions
- **ClickHouse Default**: ClickHouse provides superior performance for analytics workloads compared to PostgreSQL
- **Single Database**: Removing dual-database support significantly reduces complexity without functional loss
- **Archive Focus**: Columnar storage architecture aligns perfectly with state expiry analysis requirements
- **Performance Priority**: Native database features provide better performance than abstraction layers

### Implementation Learnings
- **Query Optimization**: ClickHouse aggregate functions provide significant performance benefits over generic SQL
- **API Design**: Specialized endpoints perform better than generic analytics endpoints
- **Code Simplification**: Removing unused abstraction layers improves maintainability and performance
- **Testing Strategy**: Single-database testing is significantly more straightforward and reliable

### ClickHouse Query Development Lessons
- **Aggregate Function Nesting**: ClickHouse doesn't allow aggregate functions inside other aggregate functions directly
  - Use intermediate subqueries with GROUP BY to compute aggregate functions first
  - Then apply conditional logic on the aggregated results in outer queries
- **AggregateFunction Type Handling**: Use `countMerge()` to extract values from AggregateFunction columns
  - Must include proper GROUP BY clauses when using countMerge
  - Cannot directly use countMerge inside countIf - need intermediate queries
- **Schema Alignment**: Ensure query field names match actual database schema
  - `storage_slot` vs `slot_key` field naming must be consistent
  - Table aliases must be properly namespaced to avoid conflicts
- **Test Data Integrity**: Test data structure must match expected schema exactly
  - Empty maps `{}` vs properly populated storage slot maps
  - Hex string formatting and address validation requirements
