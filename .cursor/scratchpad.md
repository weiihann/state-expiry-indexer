# State Expiry Indexer: Comprehensive Analytics Extension

## Background and Motivation

### Analytics Extension Overview
The current analytics system provides basic state expiry analysis but needs comprehensive extension to support detailed state analysis questions. The user has requested support for 15 specific analytics questions that require new data structures, API endpoints, and database queries.

**Current Analytics System Status:**
‚úÖ **Existing Analytics (Partially Complete):**
- Account expiry analysis (EOA vs Contract) - Questions 1, 4 (partial)
- Storage slot expiry analysis - Questions 4 (partial)
- Top contracts by expired storage slots - Question 7
- Contract storage expiry percentages - Question 11
- Fully expired contracts - Question 9
- Active contracts with expired storage - Question 8

‚ùå **Missing Analytics (New Requirements):**
- Single access frequency analysis - Question 5
- Block activity analysis - Questions 6, 13
- Time series analysis - Questions 12, 14
- Storage volume analysis - Questions 10, 15
- Enhanced total counts - Questions 1-3 (complete breakdown)

### Test Case Refactoring Overview
The current test infrastructure requires comprehensive refactoring to ensure robust coverage of the newly implemented analytics system. Analysis of existing test files reveals several critical issues that impact code quality and maintainability:

**Current Test Coverage Issues:**
‚ùå **API Tests (`internal/api/server_test.go`):**
- Inconsistent test patterns between integration and unit tests
- Basic MockRPCWrapper with limited edge case coverage
- Missing tests for new analytics endpoints (Questions 1-15)
- Incomplete error handling scenarios
- Limited concurrency testing depth
- No performance/load testing for analytics endpoints

‚ùå **Repository Tests (`internal/repository/clickhouse_test.go`):**
- ~70% of analytics tests are commented out (incomplete)
- Missing comprehensive coverage for new analytics methods
- No performance benchmarks for large dataset queries
- Inconsistent test setup and data generation
- Missing edge case testing (boundary conditions, invalid data)
- No integration testing between repository layers

‚ùå **Test Infrastructure:**
- Fragmented test utilities and helper functions
- Inconsistent mock implementations across test files
- Limited test data generation capabilities
- No standardized test environments for different scenarios
- Missing comprehensive test documentation

**Target Test Quality Standards:**
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 15 analytics questions thoroughly tested
‚úÖ **Performance Validation**: Benchmarks for ClickHouse analytics queries
‚úÖ **Error Resilience**: Complete error scenario coverage
‚úÖ **Mock Sophistication**: Advanced mocking for isolated unit testing
‚úÖ **Integration Testing**: End-to-end API and repository validation
‚úÖ **Documentation**: Clear test organization and maintainability

**Target Questions for Implementation:**
1. What is the total number of EOA accounts?
2. What is the total number of contract accounts?
3. What is the total number of storage slots?
4. How many accounts/storage slots are expired?
5. How many accounts/storage slots are only accessed once?
6. What blocks saw the highest combined account+storage access count?
7. What are the top 10 contracts by expired number of storage slots?
8. How many contracts are still active but have mostly expired storage?
9. How many contracts have all of their storage slots expired?
10. How many contracts have all of their storage slots active?
11. What is the average storage slots expiry percentage for each contract?
12. How does the number of state access (EOAs, contracts, storage slots) changed over time?
13. How many accounts/slots are accessed per N blocks?
14. What is the average access frequency of accounts or slots?
15. What are the top 10 contracts by number of storage slots?

**Database Architecture Update:**

## Lessons

### Architectural Decisions
- **ClickHouse Default**: ClickHouse provides superior performance for analytics workloads compared to PostgreSQL
- **Single Database**: Removing dual-database support significantly reduces complexity without functional loss
- **Archive Focus**: Columnar storage architecture aligns perfectly with state expiry analysis requirements
- **Performance Priority**: Native database features provide better performance than abstraction layers

### Implementation Learnings
- **Query Optimization**: ClickHouse aggregate functions provide significant performance benefits over generic SQL
- **API Design**: Specialized endpoints perform better than generic analytics endpoints
- **Code Simplification**: Removing unused abstraction layers improves maintainability and performance
- **Testing Strategy**: Single-database testing is significantly more straightforward and reliable

### ClickHouse Query Development Lessons
- **Aggregate Function Nesting**: ClickHouse doesn't allow aggregate functions inside other aggregate functions directly
  - Use intermediate subqueries with GROUP BY to compute aggregate functions first
  - Then apply conditional logic on the aggregated results in outer queries
- **AggregateFunction Type Handling**: Use `countMerge()` to extract values from AggregateFunction columns
  - Must include proper GROUP BY clauses when using countMerge
  - Cannot directly use countMerge inside countIf - need intermediate queries
- **Schema Alignment**: Ensure query field names match actual database schema
  - `storage_slot` vs `slot_key` field naming must be consistent
  - Table aliases must be properly namespaced to avoid conflicts
- **Test Data Integrity**: Test data structure must match expected schema exactly
  - Empty maps `{}` vs properly populated storage slot maps
  - Hex string formatting and address validation requirements
