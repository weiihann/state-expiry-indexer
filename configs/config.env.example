# State Expiry Indexer Configuration
# Copy this file to config.env and update with your values

# Database Configuration (Required)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=user
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=state_expiry
DB_MAX_CONNS=10
DB_MIN_CONNS=2

# RPC Configuration (Required)
# Replace with your Ethereum RPC endpoint
RPC_URL=https://your-ethereum-rpc-endpoint.com
RPC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30

# API Server Configuration
API_PORT=8080
API_HOST=localhost

# File Storage Configuration
DATA_DIR=data
STATE_DIFF_DIR=data/statediffs

# Indexer Configuration
BLOCK_BATCH_SIZE=100
POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS=10
# Range size for block range processing (default: 1000)
# Determines how many blocks are processed together as a single range
# Range files are named as {start}_{end}.json.zst (e.g., 1_1000.json.zst)
# Larger ranges reduce file count but increase memory usage during processing
RANGE_SIZE=1000

# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=info
LOG_FORMAT=text
# Optional: Log to file instead of stdout (leave empty for stdout)
LOG_FILE=

# Runtime Environment
# Options: development, staging, production
ENVIRONMENT=development

# Compression Configuration
# Enable compression for new state diff files (default: true)
# When enabled, state diff files are saved as .json.zst (compressed) instead of .json
# Compression uses zstd with default settings for optimal balance of speed and compression ratio
# Typical compression ratio: 60-80% space savings on state diff JSON files
COMPRESSION_ENABLED=true

# Examples:
# COMPRESSION_ENABLED=true   # New files saved as 20000000.json.zst (compressed)
# COMPRESSION_ENABLED=false  # New files saved as 20000000.json (uncompressed)
